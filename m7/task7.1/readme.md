# Linux administration with bash.
## TASK 7.1

### Part A

I think it is not how it must be done. But the functionality works fine.</br>
Inside:
![7.1.1](./images/7.1.1.jpg)</br>
Outside:
![7.1.2](./images/7.1.2.jpg)</br>


After I slept with the thought of the existence of such script and eventually I decided to make my script slightly more resilient but it's still not so good as I want.

![7.1.3](./images/7.1.3.jpg)</br>

I have to go on for now without solving "B" and "C"


### Part B

### Part C
